As a *[developer]*, <!-- Who are we building this for? -->

I *[want to]*,  <!-- Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. 
                    What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? 
                    This statement should be implementation free — 
                    if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point. -->

*[so that]*.    <!-- How does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? 
                    What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving? -->
